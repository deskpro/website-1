# Collaborate

The editor below talks to a simple server-side service to allow
real-time [collaborative
editing](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing.html).
Everybody connected to a given document sees the same document, and
has their changes sent over to other people working on the
document.
